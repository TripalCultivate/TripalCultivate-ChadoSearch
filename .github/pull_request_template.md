### Automated Testing

     and provide a list of the assertions it makes using casual language.

     but rather say "Ensures that the return value of method X
     with these parameters is not an empty array". -->

     Make sure to include whether they need to build a docker from scratch,
     create any records, configure anything, etc. -->
